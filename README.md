Developed a multiple disease prediction system using patient data to classify and predict the likelihood of various diseases. Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. Built and trained machine learning models, including Decision Trees and Random Forest, to achieve high prediction accuracy. Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify key features and correlations in the dataset, optimizing the model's performance. Utilized Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for implementation and visualization.
